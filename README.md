# Comparative Study of Swarm Intelligence and classical dispatch algorithms for Taxi fleet optimization during surge demand scenarios

This project explores the optimization of taxi dispatch systems under surge demand conditions using Swarm Intelligence algorithms. It compares classical greedy and round robin approaches with bio-inspired metaheuristics like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), aiming to improve operational efficiency in urban taxi fleets. The simulation is based on real-world data from the 2024 NYC Yellow Taxi dataset, particularly focused on high-demand events such as the NYC Comic Con and U.S. Presidential Election Rally.

A novel hybrid algorithm combining Greedy heuristics with PSO was developed, showing superior performance in large fleet scenarios by maximizing fare collection, improving fleet utilization, and increasing completed trip counts. This system provides a realistic framework for scalable, real-time urban mobility management, and serves as a benchmark for future intelligent dispatch solutions.
